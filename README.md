## 📌 Learning

### 🏸 Badminton Pose Analysis using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based **pose analysis system** designed to help amateur badminton players improve their posture by learning from **professional players like Lee Chong Wei (LCW) and Tai Tzu Ying (TTY)**.  

✅ **Scraped & processed** badminton match videos to extract frames of key shots  
✅ **Used TensorFlow Object Detection API** to identify player poses  
✅ **Trained a CNN classifier** to recognize shots like **smash, net-drop, backhand clear, and defense**  
✅ **Applied perspective transformation & bird’s-eye view analysis** to measure lunge distance & shot consistency  

This project was part of my **learning experience in CNNs and deep learning** during college. It provided hands-on exposure to **computer vision, pose estimation, and neural network-based classification**.
