## 📌 Learning

### 🏸 Badminton Pose Analysis using Deep Learning
A deep learning-based **pose analysis system** designed to help amateur badminton players improve their posture by learning from **professional players like Lee Chong Wei (LCW) and Tai Tzu Ying (TTY)**.  

✅ **Scraped & processed** badminton match videos to extract frames of key shots  
✅ **Used TensorFlow Object Detection API** to identify player poses  
✅ **Trained a CNN classifier** to recognize shots like **smash, net-drop, backhand clear, and defense**  
✅ **Applied perspective transformation & bird’s-eye view analysis** to measure lunge distance & shot consistency  

This project was part of my **learning experience in CNNs and deep learning** during college. It provided hands-on exposure to **computer vision, pose estimation, and neural network-based classification**.

### 🎨 UI & Simulations - Inspired by Coding Train
While exploring creative coding, I followed **Daniel Shiffman’s** [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) tutorials on **p5.js** and built various UI and simulation-based projects.

✅ **A* Pathfinding Algorithm** – Implemented an interactive visualization of **A* search algorithm**, commonly used in video games.  
✅ **Lorenz Attractor Simulation** – A visualization of chaotic fluid motion using **differential equations**.  
✅ **Audio Visuals & Fluid Simulations** – Experimented with **blobby effects, audio-reactive visuals, and fluid motion**.  
✅ **Flappy Bird Clone (Genetic Algorithm)** – Implemented a Flappy Bird AI using **evolutionary algorithms** to optimize game performance.  

These projects helped me **understand UI design, physics-based simulations, and generative algorithms** in a fun and interactive way.  

### 🚖 Uber Clone (React Native)
Just like my other projects, this one was an **absolute ride!** 🎢  
A **fully functional Uber Clone** built using **React Native**, featuring real-time navigation, pricing, and ride selection.

✅ **Google APIs (Distance Matrix, Directions, Places)** – Real-time location services  
✅ **Apple & Google Maps** – Seamless integration for both platforms  
✅ **Redux State Management** – Keeps track of user data & ride details  
✅ **Tailwind CSS for React Native** – Modern, responsive UI  
✅ **Navigation System** – Smooth screen transitions
